## What is Continuous Integration

"[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day."

## What is Continuous Delivery

"[Continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released and deployed at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency."

## What is Continuous Deployment

"[Continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment) (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments. Continuous deployment contrasts with continuous delivery, a similar approach in which software functionalities are also regularly delivered and deemed to be capable of being deployed but are not deployed.
