## Agenda

This workshop covers core CI/CD concepts and best practices, reviews real-world release management and automation problems, and how to overcome them using Azure, Azure DevOps, and Octopus Deploy.

### What you will learn

We will take an existing application and get it building and testing on Azure DevOps, then configure the release, and lastly, pass the artifact through to Octopus Deploy ready for deployment.

You will get hands-on access provisioning infrastructure on Azure, building an Azure DevOps pipeline and creating an Octopus Cloud instance. You will use all of these tools to configure and prepare a build, test it, create the release and deployment pipeline of a sample application, and deploy from Dev to Test, and lastly to Production.
